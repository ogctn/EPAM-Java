Object-oriented Programming
============

In this exercise, the task is to create the implementation for a food delivery service.

Concepts from SOLID such as Dependency Inversion can be seen when looking at the data Reader classes. 

An abstract Reader defines common methods and implementations, while creating an abstract method that will be
implemented by its child classes.
The FileDataStore is communicating with the DefaultFoodDeliveryService through a common DataStore interface, thus the
initialization and storage mechanics can stay hidden to the Service implementation.

The View and FoodDeliveryService interfaces define clear boundaries between UI & backend implementations.

Description
===========
The food delivery application works in the following way (the happy path):
1. Application data initialization: read food & customer from csv files.
2. Authenticate the customer.
3. List all the foods.
4. The user selects a food and specifies the amount. If a selected food is already in the cart,
then selecting that food now and specifying its amount overwrites the old amount in the cart. 
If the new amount is 0, then the food is removed from the cart.
5. The user is prompted to add a new food:
   - a. If the user continues to shop, go back to #4.
   - b. If not, create the order.
6. Print the order details and thank the user for his/her purchase.
7. Write order details into orders.csv

There are several "unhappy path" cases that have to be taken into account:

* For functionality (1), authentication.
    * If the user enters incorrect credentials, the application writes a message to the console. There is no need to request credentials again, the application quits.
* For functionality (4), updating cart.
    * If the price of the food and pieces along with the already present cart items exceed the customer's balance, don't add the food to the cart
* In all other error cases the application can stop running.

There are two main components that communicate through the App class to implement this functionality.
A UI (View) and backend (Service) that communicate to each other through well-defined interfaces.

The View is responsible for reading user input and showing information to the user. The service will be responsible for handling the business logic.

Data Model
==========

This exercise reads food  and customer details from csv files.

Format of foods.csv
-------------------

| Name   | Calories | Description | Price (EUR)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Fideua | 558 | Noodles gone wild in a seafood fiesta | 15 |

Format of customers.csv
-----------------------

| Username | Password | Customer Id | Customer name | Account balance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Smith | SmithSecret | 2 | Josh Smith | 100 |

Expected result
---------------

    Enter customer name:Smith
    Enter customer password:SmithSecret
    Welcome, Josh Smith. Your balance is: 100 EUR.

    Foods offered today:
    - Fideua 15 EUR each
    - Paella 13 EUR each
    - Tortilla 10 EUR each
    - Gazpacho 8 EUR each
    - Quesadilla 13 EUR each

    Please enter the name and amount of food (separated by comma) you would like to buy:Tortilla,1
    Added 1 piece(s) of Tortilla to the cart.

    Please enter the name and amount of food (separated by comma) you would like to buy:
    Order (items: [Tortilla], price: 10 EUR, timestamp: 13-07-2023 12:43:36) has been confirmed.
    Your balance is 90 EUR.
    Thank you for your purchase.

Example for low balance handling:

    Please enter the name and amount of food (separated by comma) you would like to buy:Paella,10
    
    Unable to add current order for Food{name='Paella', calorie=379, description='Rice party with a saffron twist', price=13}, as with current cart content it would exceed available balance!

**Notes**:

*   The classes must have the fields and methods as defined in the class diagrams. The UML diagrams only show what is the specification of the homework. You may implement **additional methods (or even classes!)** as you see fit.
